DISCO:
- bootstrap doesn't have templates, a little harder to use compared to foundations
- very nice css styling, I do like it more than foundations, however foundations grid layout is a lot better
- tailwind is very nice
- predefined classes to style websites
- custom designs without css
- autoscales to fit features

QCC:
If I import multiple css files, which ones override which?

q0:
bootstrap: 1
