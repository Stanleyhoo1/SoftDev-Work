I want to create a flask app of a story blog website

Let's start by outlining the steps to create a Flask application for a story blog website. Here's a high-level plan:

    Set Up the Flask Environment
        Install Flask using pip.
        Create a new Flask project directory.

    Create the Flask Application
        Initialize the Flask app.
        Set up the basic structure (directories for templates, static files, etc.).

    Design the Database Schema
        Define models for Users, Stories, and Comments using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
        Set up the database.

    Implement User Authentication
        Create user registration and login features.
        Use Flask-Login for session management.

    Create Routes and Views
        Define routes for the main pages: home, story details, user profile, etc.
        Create views and templates for each route.

    Implement CRUD Operations
        Allow users to create, read, update, and delete stories.
        Implement comment functionality on stories.

    Add Styling and Front-End Features
        Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to style the website.
        Optionally, use a front-end framework like Bootstrap.

    Testing and Deployment
        Write tests for your application.
        Deploy the application to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

Let's start by setting up the Flask environment and creating a basic Flask application.

Let's create the initial files and directories for our Flask project.

Next, we can create some basic routes and views.
This is the format of the sotry website: there are 4 main webpages: home, stories in progress, contributions, and completed stories. Home is essentially all of the stories. It displays a preview of each story, which is the title and couple of sentences from the last edit with an option to make edits to the story if they havn't contruibuted already. Each user can only contribute once to each story, and the edits are directly appended to the end of each edit. If the user hasn't created an edit on a story yet, they can only view the last made edit unless the story in completed in which case they have access to the full story. The stories in progress, displays a previews of all stories in progress. Completed stories in same but for completed stories. For contributions, display stories the user can contributed to, only accesible if the user is logged in. For the editing window, users have a textbox to make edits and an open to complete a story. Pages should be accesible by navbar, except for the edit window in which you need to click a button. Changes should be saved to the database. Users must be logged in to edit stories.

Great! Let's break down the requirements and create the necessary files and code for this Flask application. We'll start by setting up the basic structure and then implement each feature step by step.
Project Structure

We'll create a project structure like this:
Code

story-blog/
    ├── app/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── routes.py
    │   ├── static/
    │   ├── templates/
    │   │   ├── base.html
    │   │   ├── home.html
    │   │   ├── in_progress.html
    │   │   ├── contributions.html
    │   │   ├── completed.html
    │   │   ├── story_edit.html
    │   └── forms.py
    ├── migrations/
    ├── venv/
    ├── .env
    ├── config.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── run.py
    └── README.md

app/__init__.py
Public code references from 7 repositories

config.py
Public code references from 1 repository

Step 2: Creating Models

We'll create the models for Users, Stories, and Edits.
app/models.py
Public code references from 14 repositories

Step 3: Creating Routes

We'll create the routes for the main pages and the editing functionality.
app/routes.py
Public code references from 10 repositories

Step 4: Creating Forms

We'll create forms for user login, registration, and story editing.
app/forms.py
Public code references from 14 repositories

Step 5: Creating Templates

We'll create the HTML templates for each page.
app/templates/base.html
Public code references from 13 repositories

app/templates/home.html
Public code references from 9 repositories

app/templates/in_progress.html
Public code references from 9 repositories

app/templates/completed.html
Public code references from 9 repositories

app/templates/contributions.html
Public code references from 3 repositories

app/templates/story_edit.html
Public code references from 1 repository

Step 6: Creating the Database and Running the App

    Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:
bash

pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_migrate flask_login flask_wtf

Save the dependencies to requirements.txt:
bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Set up the database:
bash

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade

Run the application:
bash

    flask run

Now you have a basic Flask application for a story blog website. You can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and start adding stories and edits.
